I do not know the exact state of the original .jar/.zip of this project
but here is where it stands on my laptop right now.

Basically I copied the lib/zeus 1.72.jar into this directory (test)
and then modified the .bat files to include all jars in the 
current directory like this:
java -cp "*"

Now, since they are .bat files, they can be run from
windows command prompt.  I usually do this by opening
a windows command shell from within git bash with:
> cmd
